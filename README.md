# Encryption-Key-Generator-Translator
A small Java project for generating encryption keys. Only one program file is present, the encryption key generator. I thought I would put it on here for now until I can get the translator finished

Each individual keys will be found in "C:\\JavaEncryption". If you DON'T have C: drive, then forgive me, I'm still figuring this stuff out.

# Running the file
I'm not exactly sure, but you can either figure out how to import the .java file and .class file into you're IDE OR figure out how to pack and run it using your command window.
